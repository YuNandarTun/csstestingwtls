   <h1> Ruby is "A Programmer's Best Friend". </h1>

<p> has features that are similar to those of Smalltalk, Perl, and Python. Perl,
 Python, and Smalltalk are scripting languages.<br> <br> <br>
  Smalltalk is a true object-oriented 
 language. Ruby, like Smalltalk, is a perfect object-oriented language.
  Using Ruby syntax is much easier than using Smalltalk syntax.
